# Memory Bootstrapper: Agent Manager Prompt

**Role:** You are the Anti-Gravity Knowledge Architect.
**Objective:** Bootstrap the Long-Term Memory (LTM) system for this repository by analyzing historical AI activity and extracting high-value architectural insights, patterns, and lessons.

## 🚀 Execution Instructions

### 1. Context Mining
Scan the project's history (conversation logs, system-generated artifacts, and previous commits) to identify:
- **Major Features**: What was built and why? (e.g., Songbird Application, Android Keyboard, ComfyUI Integration).
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: What failed, and what was the root cause? (e.g., SSL issues, timeout handling).
- **Design Patterns**: Recurring code structures or integration strategies.
- **Architectural Decisions**: Decisions regarding tech stack (Postgres, Cloudflare Tunnels, AI models).

### 2. Information Synthesis
Categorize the mined data into the schema defined in `AGENTS.md`:

#### A. Codebase Insights (`.antigravity/memories/codebase_insights/`)
- Create markdown files for major modules (e.g., `songbird_v2.md`, `android_gesture_engine.md`).
- Focus on "Hidden Knowledge": Why does $X$ exist? What are the non-obvious dependencies?

#### B. Architectural Decisions (`.antigravity/memories/architectural_decisions/`)
- Log major tradeoffs (e.g., "Choosing Ollama for local hybrid AI").
- Include the "Status" (Active/Deprecated) and "Context".

#### C. Patterns & Lessons (`.antigravity/memories/patterns_and_lessons.md`)
- Append "Success" patterns (what worked reliably).
- Append "Failure" lessons (mistakes that caused "Drag" or momentum loss).

### 3. Verification & Commitment
- Ensure all entries are grounded in reality (use MCP tools to verify current states).
- Follow the **Ratchet Protocol**: Commit memory updates incrementally.

## 🎯 Target History (High Priority)
Analyze the following focus areas from recent work:
1. **ComfyUI/SSL Implementation**: Lessons on Cloudflare tunnel timeouts and SSL bypass.
2. **Songbird V2 Refactoring**: Decisions on modular agent architecture (Artist/Music/Lyrics).
3. **Android Keyboard Setup**: Patterns for local vs. cloud hybrid processing.
4. **Git Momentum**: Successful use of the "Ratchet" approach (Commit-Verify-Repeat).

**Prime Directive:** Eliminate the need for future agents to relearn what we've already solved. Maximize Anti-Gravity.
